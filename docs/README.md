<img src="./images/backbone.png" height=256>

### Each Vertebrae Represents an Architectural Component

#### Examples:

- VR capable web graphics rendering library. (THREE, BABYLON)
- Entity Component System (AFRAME, ...)
- Front-End Service Worker Scheme (LOCAL_FIRST_CACHE_ALL, NETWORK_FIRST)
- Single Player or Multiplayer (REALTIME_TURNBASED, REALTIME)
- DataBase Integration (MongoDB, PostGreSQL, ...)
- Backend Language (Node, Python, Rust, Bun, Deno, Closure, Java,...)

### The CS1 Engine User Can Configure the Engine Backbone

- Reasonable defaults are in place.  User config is not required.

### Backbone Layout

- Currently happens at runtime.  
- Goal is to enable build-time backbone.

## TODO

### Document the Glitch development process 
  - For library contributors
  - For engine users
  - For server users

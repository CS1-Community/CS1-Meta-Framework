# Best Practices
___


```
- Use a few large transactions rather than many small ones. 
  Large transactions can also be efficiently streamed.
- Recognize that the network is a slow, unreliable resource 
  and develop each application to minimize its reliance 
  on the network.
- Use a well-architected representation of the data on the network. 
  The data representation should be computer-architecture agnostic,
  contain no fat, and possibly be compressed.
